# GameOfLifeModel
This is my attempt to build Conway's Game of life in a TDD fashion, following the guidelines in Arlo Belshee's <a href="https://leanpub.com/4rulesofsimpledesign">"4 Rules of Simple Design"</a>
The model was fairly simple, and it's now embellished with html, css and a 'controller' js file that bring the game to life. 
Download the source code, bring up the GameOfLife.html file in a browser, follow the instructions, and watch it go!
